# Approximate-Representation-of-Image-Contour
Digital image processing is in the ascendant. That approximate the outline of the image is one of the most important processing methods in it. Feature information can be extracted from the  profile for additional applications. Polygonal approximation is a simple and efficient image outline  approximate representation.
